The homework from the Mini Projectâ€”Student Check section of the C# Mastercourse from Tim Corey. We are to plan and build a Console Application that asks a user for their name and their age. If their name is Bob or Sue, address them as Professor. If the person is under 21, recommend they wait X years to start this class.
