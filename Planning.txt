Requirements:
Plan and build a Console application that asks a user for their name and their age. If their name is Bob or Sue, address them as Professor. If the person is under 21, recommend they wait X years to start this class.


W: Walk through the project

Console app starts, asks user for their name, gets the name.  Console asks for age, gets the age.
If the name is Bob or Sue, address them as professor.
If the person is under 21, recommend they wait 21 less their age to start the class.


O: Open up the requirements

Are we asking for first name, last name or both? => Just first name
How do we address people other than Bob or Sue? => Address them by name
Do we check for Bob or Sue's age, or just people other than Bob or Sue


U: User interface design

Prompt: "What is your first name: "
Prompt: "What is your age: "
Error prompt: "That is not a valid age."
Output for Bob or Sue: "Welcome Professor!"
Output for other person 21 or over: "Welcome {first name}!"
Output for other person under 21: "You should wait {21-age} years to start this class."


L: Logic design

Prompt for first name
Read in first name
Prompt for age
Read in text of age
Attempt to convert age in text to age in numeric
If not successful, output error prompt and go back to reading in text of age; repeat until conversion is successful
Compare first name in lowercase with "bob" or "sue", if true, output "Welcome Professor!"
If false, compare age with 21, if age < 21 output recommend they wait 21 - age to start class
If age >= 21, output "Welcome {first name}".


D: Data design


string firstName
string ageText
bool isValidAge
int age
